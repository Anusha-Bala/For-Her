                    <p class="lead"> See your doctor regularly. Prenatal care can help keep you and your baby healthyand spot problems if they occur</p>
                    
                  
                    <p class="lead">	Continue taking folic acid throughout
your pregnancy. All women capable
of pregnancy should get 400 to 800
micrograms (400 to 800 mcg or 0.4 to
0.8 mg) of folic acid every day. Getting
enough folic acid lowers the risk of some
birth defects. Taking a vitamin with folic
acid will help you to be sure you are
getting enough.</p> 
                    
                  
                      <p class="lead">	Eat a variety of healthy foods. Include
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, calciumrich
foods, lean meats, and a variety of
cooked seafood.</p> 
                    
                     
                    <p class="lead">Get all essential nutrients, including iron,
every day. Getting enough iron prevents
anemia, which is linked to preterm birth
and low-birth weight babies. Ask your
doctor about taking a daily prenatal
vitamin or iron supplement</p> 
                     
                
                    <p class="lead">Drink extra fluids, especially water </p> 

                    
                     <p class="lead">Get moving! Unless your doctor tells you
otherwise, physical activity is good for
you and your baby.  </p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">	Gain a healthy amount of weight. Gaining
more than the recommended amount
during pregnancy increases a woman’s
risk for pregnancy complications. It also
makes it harder to lose the extra pounds after childbirth. Check with your doctor
to find out how much weight you should
gain during pregnancy</p> 
                   
                    <p class="lead"> Wash hands, especially after handling raw
meat or using the bathroom</p>
                    
                     <p class="lead">	Get enough sleep. Aim for 7 to 9 hours
every night. Resting on your left side
helps blood flow to you and your baby
and prevents swelling. Using pillows
between your legs and under your belly
will help you get comfortable.</p>
                    
                     
                    <p class="lead"> 	Set limits. If you can, control the stress
in your life and set limits. Don’t be afraid
to say “no” to requests for your time and
energy. Ask for help from others.</p>
                     
                    <p class="lead">	Make sure health problems are treated and
kept under control. If you have diabetes,
control your blood sugar levels. If you
have high blood pressure, monitor it
closely. </p>
                     
                    <p class="lead">	Ask your doctor before stopping any
medicines you take or taking any new
medicines. Prescription, over-thecounter,
and herbal medicine all can harm
your baby. </p>

                    <p class="lead">Don’t smoke tobacco. Quitting is hard,
but you can do it! Ask your doctor for
help. Smoking during pregnancy passes
nicotine and cancer-causing drugs to your
baby. Smoking also keeps your baby from
getting needed nourishment and raises
the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and
infant death.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Avoid exposure to toxic substances and
chemicals, such as cleaning solvents, lead
and mercury, some insecticides, and paint.
Pregnant women should avoid exposure
to paint fumes.</p>
                    
                     <p class="lead"> Protect yourself and your baby from foodborne
illness, which can cause serious
health problems and even death. Handle,
clean, cook, eat, and store food properly.</p>
                    
                    
                     <p class="lead">Don’t drink alcohol. There is no known
safe amount of alcohol a woman can drink
while pregnant. Both drinking every day
and drinking a lot of alcohol once in a
while during pregnancy can harm the
baby.</p>
                     <p class="lead">Don’t use illegal drugs. Tell your doctor
if you are using drugs. Marijuana,
cocaine, heroin, speed (amphetamines),
barbiturates, and LSD are very dangerous
for you and your baby.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Don’t clean or change a cat’s litter
box. This could put you at risk for
toxoplasmosis, an infection that can be
very harmful to the fetus.</p>
                      <p class="lead"> Don’t eat swordfish, king mackerel, shark,
and tilefish, which are high in mercury.</p>
                    <p class="lead">  Avoid contact with rodents and with their
urine, droppings, or nesting material. This
includes household pests and pet rodents,
such as guinea pigs and hamsters. Rodents
can carry a virus that can be harmful or
even deadly to your unborn baby.</p>
                    <p class="lead"> Don’t take very hot baths or use hot
tubs or saunas. High temperatures can be
harmful to the fetus, or cause you to faint.</p>
                   <p class="lead"> Don’t use scented feminine hygiene
products. Pregnant women should
avoid scented sprays, sanitary napkins,
and bubble bath. These products might
irritate your vaginal area, and increase
your risk of a urinary tract infection or
yeast infection.</p>
                      <p class="lead"> Don’t	douche.	Douching	can	irritate	the
vagina, force air into the birth canal and
increase the risk of infection</p>
                   
                    <p class="lead"> • Avoid x-rays. If you must have dental
work or diagnostic tests, tell your dentist
or physician that you are pregnant so that
extra care can be taken</p>
